Good afternoon.
For those of you who don't know me already, my name is Martin Zl√°mal and my field of study is Environmental Engineering here at this university.

Title of my presentation is Denoising of UHF Signals based on RBPF and the Localization of PD Sources using FDTD Method in Power Transformer.
As you can see it has very complicated official title.
But it can be simplified to this: Denoising of Signals and the Localization of PD Sources.
It says everything but I am sure it can be still very complicated and I would like to go though this title and explain what's going on here.

If you have  any questions during my presentation, please ask them immediately, because it can be quite complicated topic.
There will also be time at the end of my presentation.

Before concluding, I'd like to sum up the key points again.

I'd like to finish my presentation with few words about the results and the future.
This project has become the winner of the ABB University Award 2015 in the Czech Republic.
Despite of this success...

Thank you very much for listening.
It was pleasure to be here and if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.
