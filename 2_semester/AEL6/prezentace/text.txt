Good morning.
For those of you who don't know me already, my name is Martin Zl√°mal and I am student of Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

Today's topic is going to be about my bachelor thesis.
As you can see it has very complicated official title.
I would simplify it to this one because it says everything.

The reason I want to tell you about my thesis is very simple.
I think I have been very successful with this thesis as you will hear later.
Moreover it was great opportunity to play with modern technologies and I am using them in real life.
If you have  any questions during my presentation, please ask them immediately, because it can be quite complicated topic.
There will also be time at the end of my presentation.
But first let's have a look at the structure of my talk.


Now let's take a closer look at the communication, because communication is crutial.


Before concluding, I'd like to sum up the key points again.


I'd like to finish my presentation with few words about the results and the future.
This project has become the winner of the ABB University Award 2015 in the Czech Republic.
Despite of this success...

Thank you very much for listening.
It was pleasure to be here.
If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.
